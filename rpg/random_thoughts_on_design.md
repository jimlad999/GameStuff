Collection of random thoughts on game design, either from what I have heard from other people or seen in other games.

# Random encounters
* Should always be optional. Player should be able to see the enemies as they are walking around and choose to engage or avoid them.
* Further to the above, should never be required to beat the game. Boss fights should be defeatable, though more challenging, if the player has avoided all combat.
* Item drops should become less rare the more of a same kind is defeated. Player shouldn't have to grind for rare drops. In terms of "in game logic", they defeated an enemy enough times it becomes easier to defeat and extract what they want from the enemy as an item drop.

# Choices
* Never auto select an option. Avoid players accidentally selecting an option if they are repeatedly pressing "next". Only after directional input should an option be selected.
* Number of options can have implication. e.g. 2 options can imply "right or wrong" or complete branching.

# Quests
* Main quests. Drive the story forward and give player direction. Trackable in "quest log".
* Side quests. Give the player a chance to experience something different from the main story, usually with good or early on rewards. Should always be optional and trackable in quest log.
* Repeatable quests. For gaining experience and rewards. e.g. quest board in tavern. Should always be optional and trackable in quest log. Shouldn't run out of quests to do. Limits should be in place to avoid player taking on too much. e.g. time limits to succeed, or limit number acceptable.
* Secret quests. Don't appear in the quest log and require the player to engage with the world. Separate from side quests as to encourage greater engagement with much more significant rewards. e.g. something an NPC or book says leads to next clue.

# NPCs
* Should always have something meaningful to say. e.g. lore/background, help/give directions. Avoid excessive use of "throw away lines".

# Doors
* Should always be openable. Don't put a door in a game that cannot be opened.

# Time
* Can be used to make world seem more alive. e.g. different people appear at different times of the day with different things to say, similarly different monster can change random encounters. Encourage player to revist areas throughout the game.
* Should have set easy to understand triggers of what advances time. e.g. upon moving to next area, or actual ticking clock.
* Can be used to determine outcome of quests - time sensitive quests. Player should be aware that it is time sensitive. Changes gameplay from slow/tactical to fast paced/active. e.g. player takes too long on quest and outcome may be different. Should not be detrimental to advance the game.
